# Predicting NFL prospect contribution to team success (Project Overview)
The National Football League (NFL) is one of the largest professional sports organizations in the United States; generating nearly $12 billion dollars in revenue in 2022 (NBC). Currently, there are 32 NFL teams and each year, the teams share the same goal-- winning the Super Bowl. 

A major part of acheiving this goal is having an excellent team-building process in which high quality players are brought in while navigating the NFL's salary cap. Teams can sign free agents from others teams, but they are often very expensive and make dealing with the salary cap difficult. Because of this, the annual NFL draft is highly anticipated as it allows  teams to select players eligible to leave college football in the hopes of adding talented, young individuals on team-friendly (cheap)contracts.

Owing to the complicated nature of playing football, evaluating players eligible for the draft (called prospects) is notoriously difficult. There are 22 players on the field for every play; each player typically assigned different tasks depending on their position. Teams use a combination of scouting reports, player measurements, and watching player tape to give themselves a better chance of selecting players that will do well in the NFL. 

Here, we attempt to predict a prospect's contribution to their respective team over several years based on their workout statistics at the annual NFL combine (simply a workout session for many prospects) and the value of the draft slot they are taken at.
